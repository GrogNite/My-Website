    <h2>About me</h2>
    <div class="side-by-side">
        <div>
            <p>Hey, I’m Graham — self-taught tinkerer, recovering PC engineer, wannabe pilot, and currently neck-deep in HTML, CSS, and whatever else I can get my hands on.
            
            <br>

            I got into tech early, building and fixing PCs in my teens, which eventually landed me on the Compaq helpdesk during the Y2K era (yep, that one). Since then, I’ve bounced between hands-on tech and creative work — from soldering things together to printing t-shirts and machine embroidery in the family business.

            <br>

            A few years ago, I took a deep dive into cybersecurity through a bootcamp, and now I’m learning web development on my own. I’m especially into the front-end side — there's something satisfying about seeing your work come to life in the browser (and then breaking it five minutes later, obviously).

            <br>

            Outside the code, I’m a singleplayer gamer, occasional electronics dabbler, and I’ve even gone solo in a flexwing microlight (flying = amazing, fuel bills = less amazing). I’ve also started exploring 3D printing, partly because I love it, and partly because I still can’t afford a Boston Dynamics robot dog.

            <br>

            This site is my space to share what I’m learning, what I’m building, and whatever else I feel like messing with. It's not perfect — but neither am I. And that’s kind of the point.</p>
